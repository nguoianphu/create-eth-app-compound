This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app) and the
[Compound](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app/tree/develop/templates/react/compound) template.

This template contains 2 packages:

- [contracts](/packages/contracts)
- [react-app](/packages/react-app)

The React app implements a basic example for how to connect and pull data from the
[Compound](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/graphprotocol/compound-v2) subgraph.

## What is Compound?

Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of open financial applications. Read more about it in the [official documentation](https://compound.finance/developers).
